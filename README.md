Please note that some of these programs will only work when launched from a terminal or IDE (like by typing ./hw1.exe when in the correct directory). Some of them are also expecting certain files to be present, but those cases will be listed below. 

Note: The original version of HW5 is quite buggy. I had been able to get it to work fine for class, but running it today it sometimes doesn't launch, and when it does, output frequently includes garbage data. It likely has to do with the alias string being limited to 10 characters, but longer strings being passed to it. I fixed this in the HW5-Patched.c file by changing the length of the alias string to 64 characters. 

## Functions of each program

### HW1

Takes an integer and says whether it is postive or negative. 

### HW2

Takes an integer between 1 and 999,999, then returns each digit in reverse order and states whether it is divisble by 9. 

### HW3

Takes a name and an integer between 1 - 1,000,000 and displays the number in binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
Also gives the option to save that info to a file including name and date. 

### HW4

Prompts the user for a name. Then, using the file "CS222_Inet.txt", it sorts the list of usernames & IP addresses in ascending or descending order based on user input. It then saves that information to the file "222_Alias_List.txt" along with name, date, and time.
