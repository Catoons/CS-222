Please note that some of these programs will only work when launched from a terminal or IDE (like by typing ./hw1.exe when in the correct directory). Some of them are also expecting certain files to be present, but those cases will be listed below. 

## Functions of each program

### HW1

Takes an integer and says whether it is postive or negative. 

### HW2

Takes an integer between 1 and 999,999, then returns each digit in reverse order and states whether it is divisble by 9. 

### HW3

Takes a name and an integer between 1 - 1,000,000 and displays the number in binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
Also gives the option to save that info to a file including name and date. 

### HW4

Prompts the user for a name. Then, using the file "CS222_Inet.txt", it sorts the list of usernames & IP addresses in ascending or descending order based on user input. It then saves that information to the file "222_Alias_List.txt" along with name, date, and time.

### HW5
